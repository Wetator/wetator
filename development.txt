HOW TO SETUP THE IDE
====================
Currently we use
    Eclipse 2021-03 (4.19.0)
    Eclipse Checkstyle Plugin 8.42.0 (based on Checkstyle 8.42)
as IDE. All other settings (code format, warnings, etc.) are stored with the project.


HOW TO SETUP THE PROJECT
========================
Run
    mvn eclipse:eclipse
to create the the eclipse project.

!IMPORTANT! NEVER check in the folders /build and /deploy or the content of the folders /lib and /lib_src.


HOW TO BUILD THE PROJECT
========================
Just run
    mvn package
and everything will be done and placed into the folder /deploy.
